From Atlassian:

Behind every great human achievement, there is a team.

From medicine and space travel, to disaster response and pizza deliveries, our products help teams all over the planet advance humanity through the power of software.

Our mission is to help unleash the potential of every team.

These are the values that guide our business, our product development, and our brand.
As our company continues to evolve and grow, these five values remain constant.

Open company, no bullshit
Openness is root level for us. Information is open internally by default and sharing is a first principle. And we understand that speaking your mind requires equal parts brains (what to say), thoughtfulness (when to say it), and caring (how it’s said).

Build with heart and balance
“Measure twice, cut once.” Whether you're building a birdhouse or a business, this is good advice. Passion and urgency infuse everything we do, alongside the wisdom to consider options fully and with care. Then we make the cut, and we get to work.

Don’t #@!% the customer
Customers are our lifeblood. Without happy customers, we’re doomed. So considering the customer perspective - collectively, not just a handful - comes first.

Play, as a team
We spend a huge amount of our time at work. So the more that time doesn’t feel like “work,” the better. We can be serious, without taking ourselves too seriously. We strive to put what’s right for the team first – whether in a meeting room or on a football pitch.

Be the change you seek
All Atlassians should have the courage and resourcefulness to spark change – to make better our products, our people, our place. Continuous improvement is a shared responsibility. Action is an independent one.
